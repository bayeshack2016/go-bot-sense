# go-bot-sense
This module acts as the ears and eyes of the go-bot ecosystem.  This software is deployable on raspberry pi hardware and supports a variety of sensors to collect data that can be used by the go-bot AI.

go-bot-sense will be modular and expandable and something that can be customized for the specialized needs of different parks.

go-bot-sense is solar powered and easily deployed anywhere within the park.

go-bot-sense will form a mesh network and will be able to upload and download data to a mobile app. This will allow the park goer to get up to date information and also spread this information to other go-bot-sense modules within the park. Technologies such as NewAer would be leveraged for this functionality.

go-bot-sense will have flexible communication options depending on the modules selected including Wifi, Celluar, Wired, long range radio and Bluetooth LE.

go-bot-sense will be a data source for the go-bot ecosystem and will provide real time weather reports, park utilization, heat maps for popular areas of the park and much more.

go-bot-sense will have social media integration and allow folks to seamlessly checkin at various points in the park experience and will feature a game aspect where folks will gain points by exploring all parts of the park.
